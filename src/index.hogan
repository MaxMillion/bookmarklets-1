        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>Bookmarklets are awesome. The sit in your favourites quietly without hogging any resources and they're quick to add and even quicker to use. They provide a wide variety of features on all kinds of sites. But some sites make it terribly hard to find their bookmarklets, others don't even officially provide one. That's why I created this site. This is a place to find bookmarklets for your favourite websites, be it social media sites like Twitter, Facebook or Tumblr, or sites like GitHub, Gist, and Zootool.</p>
        <p>It's as simple as dragging and dropping a bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar. You can instantly recognize exactly which bookmarklet is which, as they're saved as "Network: Action". This is great for organising your bookmarklets and you'll be a pro in using them in no time.</p>
        <p>It's really easy to add new entries. Just follow the documentation in the GitHub repo.</p>
